        severity="Warning"
        message="Library lint checks out of date;&#xA;these checks **will be skipped**!&#xA;&#xA;Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.fragment.lint.FragmentIssueRegistry`)&#xA;which was compiled against an older version of lint&#xA;than this one. This is usually fine, but not in this&#xA;case; some basic verification shows that the lint&#xA;check jar references (for example) the following API&#xA;which is no longer valid in this version of lint:&#xA;org.jetbrains.uast.kotlin.KotlinUClass: org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtClassOrObject getKtClass()&#xA;(Referenced from androidx/fragment/lint/OnCreateDialogIncorrectCallbackDetector$UastHandler.class)&#xA;&#xA;Therefore, this lint check library is **not** included&#xA;in analysis. This affects the following lint checks:&#xA;`FragmentTagUsage`&#xA;`FragmentAddMenuProvider`&#xA;`FragmentBackPressedCallback`&#xA;`FragmentLiveDataObserve`&#xA;`UseRequireInsteadOfGet`&#xA;`UseGetLayoutInflater`&#xA;`DialogFragmentCallbacksDetector`&#xA;`UnsafeRepeatOnLifecycleDetector`&#xA;`DetachAndAttachSameFragment`&#xA;&#xA;Recompile the checks against the latest version, or if&#xA;this is a check bundled with a third-party library, see&#xA;if there is a more recent version available.&#xA;&#xA;Version of Lint API this lint check is using is 11.&#xA;The Lint API version currently running is 13 (7.3+)."

        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.">

        explanation="Methods which perform `SDK_INT` version checks (or field constants which reflect the result of a version check) in libraries should be annotated with `@ChecksSdkIntAtLeast`. This makes it possible for lint to correctly check calls into the library later to correctly understand that problematic code which is wrapped within a call into this library is safe after all."
