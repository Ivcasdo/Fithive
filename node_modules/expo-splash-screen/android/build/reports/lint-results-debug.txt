C:\Users\ivan\.gradle\caches\transforms-3\95aa226eacca12cc12323d65fdade91f\transformed\fragment-1.4.1\jars\lint.jar: Warning: Library lint checks out of date;
these checks will be skipped!

Lint found an issue registry (androidx.fragment.lint.FragmentIssueRegistry)
which was compiled against an older version of lint
than this one. This is usually fine, but not in this
case; some basic verification shows that the lint
check jar references (for example) the following API
which is no longer valid in this version of lint:
org.jetbrains.uast.kotlin.KotlinUClass: org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtClassOrObject getKtClass()
(Referenced from androidx/fragment/lint/OnCreateDialogIncorrectCallbackDetector$UastHandler.class)

Therefore, this lint check library is not included
in analysis. This affects the following lint checks:
FragmentTagUsage
FragmentAddMenuProvider
FragmentBackPressedCallback
FragmentLiveDataObserve
UseRequireInsteadOfGet
UseGetLayoutInflater
DialogFragmentCallbacksDetector
UnsafeRepeatOnLifecycleDetector
DetachAndAttachSameFragment

Recompile the checks against the latest version, or if
this is a check bundled with a third-party library, see
if there is a more recent version available.

Version of Lint API this lint check is using is 11.
The Lint API version currently running is 13 (7.3+). [ObsoleteLintCustomCheck]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

D:\universidad\TFG\RepositorioAplicacion\TFG\node_modules\expo-splash-screen\android\src\main\java\expo\modules\splashscreen\SplashScreenReactActivityLifecycleListener.kt:35: Warning: Implicitly using the default locale is a common source of bugs: Use toLowerCase(Locale) instead. For strings meant to be internal use Locale.ROOT, otherwise Locale.getDefault(). [DefaultLocale]
      context.getString(R.string.expo_splash_screen_resize_mode).toLowerCase()
                                                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DefaultLocale":
   Calling String#toLowerCase() or #toUpperCase() without specifying an
   explicit locale is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that
   those methods will use the current locale on the user's device, and even
   though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app,
   it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the
   uppercase replacement for i is not I.

   If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to
   convert an enum name, call String#toUpperCase(Locale.US) instead. If you
   really want to use the current locale, call
   String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault()) instead.

class SplashScreenView(
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "CustomSplashScreen":
   Starting in Android 12 (API 31+), the application's Launch Screen is
   provided by the system and the application should not create its own,
   otherwise the user will see two splashscreens. Please check the
   SplashScreen class to check how the Splash Screen can be controlled and
   customized.

D:\universidad\TFG\RepositorioAplicacion\TFG\node_modules\expo-splash-screen\android\src\main\res\values\styles_splashscreen.xml:5: Warning: The resource R.style.Theme_App_SplashScreen appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
  <style name="Theme.App.SplashScreen" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

D:\universidad\TFG\RepositorioAplicacion\TFG\node_modules\expo-splash-screen\android\src\main\res\drawable\splashscreen_image.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
